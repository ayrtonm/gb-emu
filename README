Gb-emu is a Game Boy/Game Boy Color Emulator for Linux. This project was started in June 2013 but is still a work in progress.

Why
---
Gb-emu was started as an educational project so I could learn more about general computer architecture and the underlying operations of the old game console.


Command-Line Arguments
----------------------
Since gb-emu is currently a work in progress, a lot (most) of the command line arguments are used for debugging and aren't really useful for running games.  I am considering adding a completely revamped debug UI after everything is working. Run with the -h flag to see all options.


Special Thanks

In no particular order special thanks goes to the following projects: 'RealBoy', 'Mednafen', 'VisualBoyAdvance'
