Gb-emu is a work-in-progress Game Boy/Game Boy Color Emulator for Linux.

|---|
|Why|
|---|
Gb-emu was started as an educational project so I could learn more about general computer architecture and the underlying operations of the old game console.

|Command-Line Arguments|
|----------------------|
Since gb-emu is currently a work in progress, a lot (most) of the command line arguments are used for debugging and aren't really useful for running games.  I am considering adding a completely revamped debug UI after everything is working. Run with the -h flag to see all options.
